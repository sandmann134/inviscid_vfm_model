This is the core code for an inviscid computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on the Vortex Filament Method (VFM).  
It was designed for a planar free-shear layer case, but has been built to work with ring vortices as well, and the latter 
is one of the test cases used for validation.

The documentation on this is lacking as several additions are still in progress, but the core functionality is here.

Feel free to contact with any questions.
